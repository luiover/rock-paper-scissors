# The project
Ever wanted to test your Rock Paper Scissors skills, trying to beat the machine? Now you can challenge a pseudo-random machine at my (and probably your) favorite game!
But this is more than a game, this is an **experience**. It's hard to explain... just go try it out!

# The back-stage
This project has took me a lot of hours of frustation and effort, but I like it how it turned out. For this project I decided to start by writing a simple version without an User Interface. Then I made it use three buttons and a paragraph to display the results of the round. Since it wasn't a well-designed interface, for this project I decided to try something new: design first the ideal interface (with Figma) and only then implement it. It turned out quite good and this is the result of hours of work behind a screen.

# What did I learn?
With this project, I gained familiarity with DOM Manipulations, handling buttons and click events: but not only. I got really creative with the styling and in fact I grasped some CSS techniques to make an UI fabulous. I gained an understanding of creating projects by zero, and the steps to do so. This project has been really fun to create and I like how it turned out.
